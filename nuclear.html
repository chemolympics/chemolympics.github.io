      <h2>Nuclear Energy</h2>
      <h3>Nuclear Fission</h3>
      Nuclear power uses nuclear fission to generate heat and electricity ("Nuclear").
      This is a process that will break apart the bonds that hold the nuclei of atoms together, releasing an enormous amount of energy. 
      In a typical nuclear power plant, uranium atoms are used. 
      A neutron will collide with a uranium atom, which will break the bonds in the nucleus, releasing even more neutrons and causing a chain reaction ("Nuclear Explained").<br>
      According to Key and Ball, the process of nuclear fission as it is used in nuclear power plants is based on the principle of converting mass into energy. For example, given the equation for nuclear decay of Uranium-235 $$^{235}\text{U} \rightarrow \phantom{}^{139}\text{Ba} + \phantom{}^{94}\text{Kr} + 2^{1}\text{n},$$ the left side has a total mass of 235.0439 g, while the right side has a total mass of 234.8605 g.
      The mass that is missing on the right-hand side of the equation was converted into energy according to the equation \(E = mc^2\), such that the nuclear fission equation actually looks like $$^{235}\text{U} \rightarrow \phantom{}^{139}\text{Ba} + \phantom{}^{94}\text{Kr} + 2^{1}\text{n} + \text{energy}.$$
      This energy is on the order of billions of kilojoules per mole reacted, compared to only hundreds of kilojoules for conventional hydrocarbons (Key and Ball).
      <h3>Direction</h3>
      The efficiency of nuclear fission makes nuclear energy a promising option as an alternative energy source. As written by <a href="https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/low-energy-fridays-why-arent-we-using-more-nuclear-energy/">Rossetti</a>, "when nuclear power was first getting its legs, the promise was that it would make electricity 'too cheap to meter,' since uranium is so inexpensive, abundant and energy-dense that it was expected to effectively solve energy scarcity." However, at our current level of technology, it tends to be cheaper, in most cases, to build a natural gas facility than a nuclear power plant (Rossetti). This is counterproductive to the goal of producing less greenhouse gases.
      <h3>Current Technology</h3>
      According to the <a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/nuclear-power-reactors/nuclear-power-reactors.aspx">World Nuclear Association</a>, the components that are essential to a nuclear reactor are:
      <ul>
        <li>The fuel (uranium-235) used for nuclear fission to take place</li>
        <li>A medium (water, heavy water, or graphite) used to slow the neutrons down such that they cause more fission</li>
        <li>Rods made of neutron-absorbing material (cadmium, hafnium, or boron) used to control the rate that neutrons collide with the Uranium-295</li>
        <li>A refrigerant used to transfer excess heat away from the reactor to contribute to energy production (<a href="geothermal.html">this page</a> elaborates more on the chemical structure of refrigerants)</li>
        <li>A vessel or tubes to regulate the pressure</li>
        <li>A steam generator, using heat carried by the refrigerant to power a turbine using steam</li>
        <li>A thick concrete and steel structure surrounding the plant to prepare for the case of an accident ("Nuclear Power").</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Is one of the safest and cheapest forms of energy (Rossetti). The largest nuclear incident in the U.S. (Three Mile
        Island) had no fatalities or injuries ("Chernobyl Accident").</li>
      <li>Uranium is inexpensive, abundant, and energy-dense (Rossetti). Density leads to minimal waste ("3 Reasons").</li>
      <li>Low amount of land needed to produce a large amount of energy ("3 Reasons").</li>
      <li>The (faulty) design of the Chernobyl reacter is not used by any U.S. power plants (Rossetti).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Large and expensive tools and facilities are needed to produce energy from uranium (Rossetti).</li>
      <li>The Chernobyl disaster led to 143 diagnoses of acute radiation syndrome and 28 deaths within a few weeks, as
        well as a maximum of 300 to 500 long-term deaths (Rossetti).</li>
      <li>Constant demand for regulation causes building new nuclear reactors to be more and more expensive (Rossetti).</li>
      <li>While Uranium-235 may undergo nuclear fission, Uranium-238 does not (and makes up more than 99% of the total supply of Uranium). Furthermore, the Uranium-235 must be enriched to about 3% to be useful in a nuclear reactor (Key and Ball).</li>
