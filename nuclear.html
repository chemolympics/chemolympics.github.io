      <h2>Nuclear Energy</h2>
      Nuclear power uses nuclear fission to generate heat and electricity ("Nuclear").
      This is a process that will break apart the bonds that hold the nuclei of atoms together, releasing an enormous amount of energy. 
      In a typical nuclear power plant, uranium atoms are used. 
      A neutron will collide with a uranium atom, which will break the bonds in the nucleus, releasing even more neutrons and causing a chain reaction ("Nuclear Explained").<br>
      According to Key and Ball, the process of nuclear fission is used to convert mass into energy. For example, given the equation for nuclear decay $$^{235}\text{U} \rightarrow \phantom{}^{139}\text{Ba} + \phantom{}^{94}\text{Kr} + 2^{1}\text{n},$$ the left side has a total mass of 235.0439 g, while the right side has  234.8605 g.
      The mass that is missing on the right-hand side of the equation was converted into energy according to the equation \(E = mc^2\), such that the nuclear fission equation actually looks like $$^{235}\text{U} \rightarrow \phantom{}^{139}\text{Ba} + \phantom{}^{94}\text{Kr} + 2^{1}\text{n} + \text{energy}.$$
      This energy is on the order of billions of kilojoules per mole reacted, compared to only hundreds of kilojoules for conventional hydrocarbons (Key and Ball).

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Is one of the safest and cheapest forms of energy (Rossetti). The largest nuclear incident in the U.S. (Three Mile
        Island) had no fatalities or injuries ("Chernobyl Accident").</li>
      <li>Uranium is inexpensive, abundant, and energy-dense (Rossetti). Density leads to minimal waste ("3 Reasons").</li>
      <li>Low amount of land needed to produce a large amount of energy ("3 Reasons").</li>
      <li>The (faulty) design of the Chernobyl reacter is not used by any U.S. power plants (Rossetti).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Large and expensive tools and facilities are needed to produce energy from uranium (Rossetti).</li>
      <li>The Chernobyl disaster led to 143 diagnoses of acute radiation syndrome and 28 deaths within a few weeks, as
        well as a maximum of 300 to 500 long-term deaths (Rossetti).</li>
      <li>Constant demand for regulation causes building new nuclear reactors to be more and more expensive (Rossetti).</li>
      <li>While Uranium-235 may undergo nuclear fission, Uranium-238 does not, and makes up more than 99% of the supply of Uranium. The Uranium-235 must be <em>enriched</em> to about 3% to be useful in a nuclear reactor (Key and Ball).</li>
    </ul>
