      <h2>Hydrogen Energy</h2>
      <h3>Hydrogen Fuel Cells</h3>
      The most common type of hydrogen fuel cell is called a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. A PEM cell
      works by sandwiching an electrolyte membrane between an anode and a cathode. Positively-charged hydrogen is
      introduced to the anode and negatively-charged oxygen, from air, to the cathode. Protons travel through the
      membrane from the anode to the cathode, producing an electrical current that can then be utilized.<sup>6</sup>
      In the case of a hydrogen fuel cell, the positive ions are made of hydrogen and the negative ions are made of
      oxygen:<sup>28</sup>

      <h3>Electrolyte Membrane</h3>
      In the diagram above, the electrolyte membrane is in the center layer, between where the oxygen and hydrogen are
      introduced into the cell. According to Grujicic and Chittajallu, the chemical structure consists of three regions:
      <ol>
        <li>A fluorocarbon backbone with hundreds of repeating
          \(-\text{C}\text{F}_2-\text{C}\text{F}-\text{C}\text{F}_2-\) units.</li>
        <li>\(-\text{O}-\text{C}\text{F}_2-\text{C}\text{F}-\text{O}-\text{C}\text{F}_2-\text{C}\text{F}_2-\) side
          chains which connect the backbone to the third region.</li>
        <li>Ionic clusters of sulfonic acid ions (\(\text{S}\text{O}_3^{-} \text{ H}^{+}\)). The
          \(\text{S}\text{O}_3^{-}\) ions attach to the side chains (region 2) and stay immobile; however, when water is
          introduced, the \(\text{H}^{+}\) ions form hydronium ions (\(\text{H}_3\text{O}^{+}\)) and easily hop between
          \(\text{S}\text{O}_3^{-}\) sites in the membrane, allowing the PEM to conduct hydrogen ions.<sup>10</sup></li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Producing hydrogen</h3>
      To isolate the hydrogen for the fuel cell, a process known as <em>electrolysis</em> is commonly used.<sup>12</sup>
      According to <em>LibreTexts Chemistry</em>, the electrolytic cell contains two platinum electrodes in water containing a small amount of
      electrolyte (e.g. \(\text{H}_2\text{S}\text{O}_4\)) to carry charge. Electrolysis would look like the following,
      at the anode and cathode, respectively:
      $$\begin{align*}2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{O}_2(g) + 4\text{H}^{+}(aq) + 4e^{-} \quad E^0 &= -1.23
      \text{ V}\\ 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) + 2e^{-} \rightarrow \text{H}_2(g) + 2\text{O}\text{H}^{-}(aq) \quad E^0 &=
      -0.83 \text{ V}.\end{align*}$$
      The overall reaction is then \(2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{O}_2(g)\) with a value of
      \(E_{\text{cell}}^0 = -2.06 \text{ V}\).<sup>25</sup> Platinum is commonly used because it is relatively inert, so it will not
      give away or attempt to steal electrons in one of the redox reactions; however, platinum and other noble metals
      are expensive, which is a disadvantage for the process.<sup>15</sup> <br>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hydrogen energy is environmentally friendly because a hydrogen fuel cell only emits \(\text{H}_2\) and
        \(\text{O}\).<sup>11</sup></li>
      <li>By weight, has an energy yield 2.75 times greater than hydrocarbon fuels.<sup>15</sup></li>
      <li>Can be integrated into variable/intermittent renewable power generators such as wind farms, allowing
        flexibility and less new infrastructure needed.<sup>12</sup></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Current production methods cost more than double that of diesel and petrol and are not commercially viable.<sup>11</sup></li>
      <li>Using current grid energy to produce hydrogen would result in greenhouse emissions depending on your location,
        which just shifts the problem down the line.<sup>12</sup></li>
