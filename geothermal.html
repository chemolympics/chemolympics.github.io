      <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
      <p>Geothermal energy uses heat from below the Earth's surface to generate electricity or heat and cool buildings.
        It is a renewable resource that emits little greenhouse gases [e].</p>
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <h3>Heat pump</h3>
        <p>The heat pump approach works similarly to an air conditioner.
          It moves a refrigerant through pipes just below the Earth's surface, where the temperature remains at 50&degF to 60&degF, to air ducts within a building to heat it directly [e].
          If the temperature within the house is colder than this (in the winter), the house will warm up. 
          In the summer, this will cool down the house [f]. Thus, it is a robust system that requires little maintanence or continued costs.

        <h2>Benefits/Costs</h2>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Relatively low marginal costs once a geothermal system is built [e]</li>
        <li>Existing oil and natural gas wells can be used to produce geothermal power at the same time [e]</li>
        <li>Emit significantly less acid rain-causing compounds and greenhouse gases than fossil fuel plants of similar size [g].</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>May contaminate groundwater resources with minerals produced from geothermal wells [e]</li>
        <li>It is possible that drilling could lead to increased earthquakes in surrounding areas [e]</li>
        <li>Small amounts of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide may still be released [g]</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Map</h2>
      <p>Geothermal energy is distributed throughout the United States as shown in this graph (data from [u]).

      Geothermal energy is most effective in the western U.S. and Hawaii because the Ring of Fire, one of the most active geothermal areas in the world, is located here. The Ring of Fire contains long stretches where tectonic plates overlap, allowing magma to come close to the suface and heat water, after which energy can be produced [u].
