      <p>Geothermal energy uses heat from below the Earth's surface to generate electricity or heat and cool buildings.
        It is a renewable resource that emits little greenhouse gases [e].</p>
      <h3>Heat pump</h3>
      <p>The heat pump approach uses a refrigerant (a compound effective at changing between liquid and gas states)
        through pipes just below the Earth's surface, where the temperature remains at 50&degF to 60&degF, to air ducts
        within a building to heat it directly [e].
        If the temperature within the house is colder than this (in the winter), the house will warm up.
        In the summer, this will cool down the house [f]. Thus, it is a robust system that requires little maintanence
        or continued costs.

      <h3>Refrigerants</h3>
      One of the most common refrigerants used today is called R-134a and has the chemical formula
      \(\text{C}_2\text{H}_2\text{F}_4\).
      To produce R-134a, two steps are used.
      First, trichloroethylene (\(\text{C}_2\text{H}\text{Cl}_3\)) is reacted isothermally with hydrogen fluoride at
      \(341^\circ \text{C}\) and \(1 \text{ atm}\) to produce R-133a and hydrogen chloride:
      $$\text{C}_2\text{H}\text{Cl}_3 + 3 \text{H}\text{F} \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_2\text{Cl}\text{F}_3 +
      2\text{H}\text{Cl}.$$
      The second step is to react the R-133a with hydrogen fluoride at \(329^\circ \text{C}\) and \(1 \text{ atm}\):
      $$\text{C}_2\text{H}_2\text{Cl}\text{F}_3 + \text{H}\text{F} \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_2\text{F}_4 +
      \text{H}\text{Cl}.$$
      The production process for this reaction has been optimized for efficiency such that the second reaction actually
      happens before the first, using the intermediate R-133a and unreacted hydrogen fluoride distilled in two chambers.
      The excess \(\text{H}\text{Cl}\) may then be sold to the commodity market [v 9].<br>
      R-134a and similar hydrofluorocarbons may be phased out in the early 2030s because they have a high global warming
      potential if they escape into the atmosphere [w 593].
      Alternatives are being developed with a focus on reducing the atmospheric lifespan of the refrigerants. For example, fluoroiodocarbons (FICs) have an atmospheric lifespan estimated in days, while HFCs like R-134a have an atmospheric lifespan of at most 300 <em>years</em>. Hydrofluorooelifins (HFOs) have an even lower global warming potential and a lifespan of less than 20 years, but are not as efficient as alternatives [w 594, 595].
      <h3>Power plant</h3>
      An alternative mode of utilizing geothermal energy is to drill deep wells (often more than a mile deep) in
      geothermally active areas, then tap steam and hot water from underground. The steam can be used to run a turbine
      and generate electricity [e].

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Relatively low marginal costs once a geothermal system is built [e]</li>
      <li>Existing oil and natural gas wells can be used to produce geothermal power at the same time [e]</li>
      <li>Emit significantly less acid rain-causing compounds and greenhouse gases than fossil fuel plants of similar
        size [g].</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>May contaminate groundwater resources with minerals produced from geothermal wells [e]</li>
      <li>It is possible that drilling could lead to increased earthquakes in surrounding areas [e]</li>
      <li>Small amounts of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide may still be released [g]</li>
    </ul>

    Geothermal energy is most effective in the western U.S. and Hawaii because the Ring of Fire, one of the most active
    geothermal areas in the world, is located here. The Ring of Fire contains long stretches where tectonic plates
    overlap, allowing magma to come close to the suface and heat water, after which energy can be produced [u].
