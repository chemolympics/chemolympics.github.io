      <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
      <p>Geothermal energy uses heat from below the Earth's surface to generate electricity or heat and cool buildings.
        It is a renewable resource that emits little greenhouse gases [e].</p>
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Relatively low marginal costs once a geothermal system is built [e]</li>
        <li>Existing oil and natural gas wells can be used to produce geothermal power at the same time [e]</li>
        <li>Emit significantly less acid rain-causing compounds and greenhouse gases than fossil fuel plants of similar size [g].</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>May contaminate groundwater resources with minerals produced from geothermal wells [e]</li>
        <li>It is possible that drilling could lead to increased earthquakes in surrounding areas [e]</li>
        <li>Small amounts of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide may still be released [g]</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Map</h2>
      <p>Geothermal energy is distributed throughout the United States as shown in this graph (data from [u]).

      Geothermal energy is most effective in the western U.S. and Hawaii because the Ring of Fire, one of the most active geothermal areas in the world, is located here. The Ring of Fire contains long stretches where tectonic plates overlap, allowing magma to come close to the suface and heat water, after which energy can be produced [u].
